# Inventory Assignment
###### By: Carson Custer, Wayeera Robertson, and Carter Bourne
---
This project contains a basic player controller that snaps the player object left and right on a grid, while also putting a limit on how far the player can go in both directions (which can be edited in the inspector). Also in this project is a parent/child relationship interface that allows a parent class control the basic picking up function, while the children scripts handle what the specific item will do. In the case of this project, we have an item that when the player collects, it adds to the players score, while the other item kills the player on contact. 

### Collaboration
---
Collaboration among the group went exceptionally well, as each person had their designated task and fullfilled them relatively early. Way was responsible for getting the parent/child infterface up and running in the project, Carson worked on getting the items to instantiate above the track to give the project an infinite runner feeling, and Carter was responsible for getting a UI working so that when the player picked up a score item, it would add to the score. As we all had our own designated tasks, we still helped each other when we would run into problems. Everyone essentially built each part even if they were not directly responsible for that part of the project.
